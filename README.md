# Divisors
Programs to do with devisors (eg. find the smallest number with x divisors)

## FindSmallest
Finds the smallest number with x divisors by using primes factorization.
    - The "res_divisibility" folder holds a text file with 210333 primes in it. Place this folder in the location that the program wil be running (when debugging: *"FindSmallest\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1"* for me) if you don't want to have to generate all the primes on the fly as this can take a while.

## ListDivisors
List the prime factorization and all the divisors of a given number
    - This too uses the "res-divisibility" folder and its conetents.
